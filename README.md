### Project Description
[Prosolutions is a playful, interactive mock search engine designed to surprise users with unexpected results. Instead of delivering real search answers, it responds with memes, funny messages, or light-hearted pranks, creating a delightful and humorous user experience.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

While the world is busy answering questions, we‚Äôre here giving you memes, jokes, and unexpected fun instead of real answers. Because sometimes, all you need is a good laugh‚Äînot a Google result.
